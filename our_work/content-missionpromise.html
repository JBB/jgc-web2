<p>Residents of San Francisco’s Mission District face multiple challenges to socioeconomic success, including high poverty rates, a lack of affordable housing, and language barriers.  Additionally, despite the fact that San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) is one of the highest performing school districts in California, significant disparities exist within it, and seven of the district’s ten lowest performing schools are in the Mission neighborhood. While many organizations are already working within the Mission District to effect change, there is currently no coordinated approach to providing services. An opportunity exists for these providers to join forces and collaborate on issues like early learning and development, student achievement and school improvement, family economic success, and strong and safe neighborhoods.</p>
<br>
<p>In December 2012, the U.S. Department of Education selected the Mission Economic Development Agency (MEDA) to receive a $30M federal grant to create the Mission Promise Neighborhood in San Francisco’s Mission District; MEDA then selected the Gardner Center as their research and evaluation partner. MEDA’s goal is to build a continuum of community services and resources that will shepherd children from cradle to college and career and, in turn, make the Mission neighborhood healthier and more successful overall. Specifically, the grant will support organizations and programs that work with the families of students attending San Francisco’s Bryant Elementary, Cesar Chavez Elementary, Everett Middle School, and John O’Connell High School.</p>   
<br>
<p>The Gardner Center’s role is to partner with MEDA and the national evaluator of Promise Neighborhoods to design and manage the evaluation process; build capacity among the Mission Promise Neighborhood’s network of 20+ partner organizations (which include SFUSD, city/county agencies, and Community-Based Organizations); and assist MEDA in creating standards and parameters around data. In addition to collecting, linking, and analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data through the Youth Data Archive, the Gardner Center will share our findings with the Mission community and the public at large.</p>
