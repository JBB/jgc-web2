<h1 class="title-page-header-big">Leadership Development & Capacity Building</h1><br>

          <h1 class="content-text-header">Leadership Development</h1>
<br>
<p>The Gardner Center supports leaders within school districts and local youth-serving public agencies and community  based organizations to expand their potential by working cooperatively and collaboratively toward common goals.  In this sense, leadership development involves changing the paradigm from merely individually effective leaders to those who "can work in networks of responsibility" as John W. Gardner once wrote, to improve youth outcomes across boundaries and contexts.</p>
<br>  

<p>We conduct leadership development through facilitation of initiatives and trainings that include:</p>
<br>
<ol> 
<li>Cross-sector planning and community development</li>
<li>Youth led research and youth leadership development</li>
<li>Youthâ€“adult partnerships to meet community-identified goals or outcomes</li>
<li>Stanford student support and training (internships, positions, course connections)</li>
</ol> 
<br>

<h1 class="content-text-header">Capacity Building</h1>
<br>

<p>
The Gardner Center works with partners to develop and expand their skills and knowledge about researchable questions, data collection and interpretation, and valid and reliable indicators of positive youth development that will result in actionable findings to improve outcomes for youth. The Gardner Center builds capacity through ongoing partnerships that inquire deeply into "what works for youth" in and across settings and systems, and projects that:
</p>
<br>
<ol> 
<li>Use data to drive action.</li>
<li>Embed youth development as a city-wide approach to create thriving environments for youth.</li>
<li>Facilitate the creation of shared frameworks to guide planning, decision making, and ongoing capacity building.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h1 class="content-text-header">Fellowship Opportunities</h1>
<br>
<p>
 The Gardner Center is proud to foster opportunities for youth and young adults to participate in the fields of 
        youth development and community-based research. This year we are partnering with the Shinnyo-En Foundation and the Haas Center for Public Service to host a post-undergraduate fellow, <a href="/about_jgc/fellows.html">Carolina Ornelas</a>, to collaborate with youth-serving organizations in our near neighbor community of Redwood City.
