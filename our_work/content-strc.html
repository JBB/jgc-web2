<p>The Sequoia Teen Resource Center (STRC) provides free confidential counseling, and youth development services to help students at Sequoia High School (SHS) increase their academic performance, improve behavior and personal relationships, make positive decisions and set future goals. Service providers within STRC include: Center for Youth (CFY), Teen Talk, Youth and Family Enrichment Services (StarVista). Although these providers offer different types of services, they share a common goal of trying to promote positive youth development and reinforce healthy behaviors.  In partnership with STRC, the JGC is conducting an evaluation aimed at understanding how the STRC as a whole affects the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that lead to positive outcomes for youth at Sequoia High School. </p>
