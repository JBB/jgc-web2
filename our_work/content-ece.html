<br>

<p>The Early Childhood and Community Schools Linkages Project addresses the lack of collaboration and continuity across Early Childhood Education (ECE) programs and elementary schools by linking ECE programs with Community Schools. Since 2009, three regions (Multnomah County, OR; Albuquerque, NM; and Tulsa, OK) have been developing models to demonstrate that community schools are effective vehicles for promoting continuity between ECE and elementary school.</p>

<br>

<p>The JGC conducts implementation research and helps build capacity among regional Linkages leaders and their colleagues. The three-year implementation study documents each regionâ€™s process in establishing ECE community schools linkages, with the goal of determining what conditions appear to facilitate and/or hinder the building of linkages.</p>
