<p>A group of California school districts representing over a million students have come together to form a learning cooperative called the California Office to Reform Education (CORE). The CORE member districts—Fresno, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Oakland, Sacramento, San Francisco, Sanger, and Santa Ana—received a waiver from federal accountability requirements of the No Child Left Behind Law on August 6, 2013. The waiver plan, called the School Quality Improvement System, calls for districts to reorient their work towards a collective effort to prepare all students for college and career, with districts assuming unprecedented accountability to eliminate disparity and disproportionality in all subjects and across the academic, social/emotional, and culture/climate domains.</p> 
<br>
<p>As part of the new accountability system, the Gardner Center is working with CORE districts to design and implement the new school accountability process, including a School Quality Improvement Index, that will begin a test launch during the 2014-15 school year.</p>
<br>
<p>The CORE districts hope that the School Quality Improvement System will be a model of professional accountability—a data driven, professional learning system—in the education field for California and the nation.</p>
