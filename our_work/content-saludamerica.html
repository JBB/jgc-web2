A Project of Salud America!</h1>
<br>



 

<p>The negative effects of childhood obesity on lifelong health outcomes have been well documented.  One promising intervention area that warrants further attention is after school programming.  Particularly for low-income and minority adolescents, productive after school activities have the potential to fulfill important needs, including: academic achievement, self-efficacy, civic engagement, and emotional regulation.  Even after school programs that are not focused on physical activity have the potential to reduce obesity if they reduce sedentary activities, such as television watching or video game playing, or if the positive developmental outcomes associated with participation translate into improved fitness. </p>

 
<br>
<p>As part of Salud America! – an initiative of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation – the John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities (JGC) at Stanford University is working with community partners in Redwood City, CA and the California Schools Boards Association (CSBA) to understand the effects of participating in a variety of after school programs on Latino and other students’ obesity and physical fitness outcomes.</p> 

 
<br>
<p>The study relies on data from the Youth Data Archive, an integrated data system that includes administrative data from public and private agencies.  Added to the archive for this analysis is a youth development survey administered in two academic years to all middle school students in the Redwood City School District.  Key research questions include:  (1) To what extent are students in grades four through nine engaged in after school programming, including that focused on physical fitness and other areas? (2) What are the effects of after school participation on youth’s obesity and physical fitness outcomes? (3) For which subgroups of youth is after school programming, and especially programming geared toward fitness, most effective?  (4) How do students’ reports of youth development indicators—including youth self-efficacy and motivation—mediate the effects between attendance, on one hand, and obesity and fitness outcomes, on the other?</p>

 <br>

<p>The study results will be shared iteratively with community partners in order to help them work together and with their students to improve fitness and reduce obesity in this community.  Policy implications of this study include resource realignment for school districts and cities to support access to after school programs of all types, continued examination of policies that support physical fitness after school, and local partnerships that support young people in accessing a variety of out-of-school programs.  Data from this study will allow school board members, superintendents, city council members and city staff to look at further opportunities to partner and provide the supports needed to reduce obesity and improve fitness among youth. Further, the CSBA will work with JGC to develop sample school board policies and recommendations for school board members throughout the state. </p>
