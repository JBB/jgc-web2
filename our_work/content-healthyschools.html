<p>
<br>
The John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities (JGC) at Stanford University, in partnership with the Sequoia Healthcare District (SHD) and four local school districts, is conducting a three-year study of the Healthy Schools Initiative (HSI). HSI seeks to improve student outcomes over the long term through increased coordination and access to health and wellness programming within districts and schools. During the first year of the study, JGC worked with SHD to develop a logic model and conducted a needs assessment, mapping health and wellness programs in the four partner districts. Years two and three of the study focus on investigating the ways in which HSI implementation affects the coordination of health and wellness programs in schools and districts and how this, in turn, influences awareness and accessibility of programs and activities. This study is a critical precursor to any future research on the ways that HSI influences individual student health outcomes.

<br>
<br>
This study examines how the Healthy Schools Initiative affects the coordination and accessibility of health and wellness programming in schools from multiple perspectives. By engaging parents, students, and school and district staff, JGC researchers investigated the following research question:
<br>
<br>
    In what ways does the Healthy Schools Initiative affect the coordination and accessibility of health and wellness programs and activities at HSI schools?
<br>
<br>
Through nearly 100 interviews and focus groups in the four partner school districts, our analyses revealed that effective and purposeful coordination of health and wellness activities was associated with increased integration of health and wellness programs within and across schools and districts, reaching more students equitably and leveraging resources.
