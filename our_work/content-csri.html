<span class="content-bold">Goal</span>
<p>Initiated in 2010 with the generous support of The Stuart Foundation, the Community School Resource Initiative (CSRI) aims to offer emerging and developing community schools with high-quality information about effective practices and access to current research related to community schools. Sessions for CSRI will emphasize data use and evaluation through the Youth Data Archive (YDA), the Gardner Center's initiative that enables cross-sector youth data analysis. The CSRI will also engage the primary community school intermediaries in the Bay Area in a series of convenings to determine how to jointly develop a comprehensive system of supports for community schools in the Bay Area and beyond.</p>
<br>
<span class="content-bold">What is a Community School?</span>
<p>A community school is both a place and a set of partnerships between the school and other community resources. Its integrated focus on academics, health and social services, youth and community development and community engagement leads to improved student learning, stronger families and healthier communities. By using schools as community hubs and a whole child approach, community schools bring together many partners to offer a range of supports and opportunities to children, youth, families and communities.</p>
<br>
<span class="content-bold">About CSRI Site Learning Sessions</span>
<p>The Community School Resource Initiative Site Learning Sessions will bring together 5 teams from schools, districts, city/county agencies, and community-based organizations to gain knowledge of community schools as a strategy to better support their youth. These sites will participate in the following activities over the course of one academic year (September 2010 - May 2011):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Three interactive sessions with national leaders in the community school field to learn about the essential dimensions of developing or enhancing a rich and vibrant community school as a hub of their community.</li>
    <li>Guidance on how to use data (including multi-agency data) to evaluate their community school and better serve youth and families in their community.</li>
    <li>Access to information about resources for targeted coaching, training, and other technical assistance in the Bay Area to develop or enhance their community school.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p>These teams will benefit from national leaders in the community schools and youth development fields, including the National Center for Community Schools of the Children's Aid Society and the Community Network for Youth Development (CNYD).</p>
<br>
<span class="content-bold">About CSRI Intermediary Sessions</span>
<p>Community school intermediary organizations are the community-based organizations that provide support and technical assistance to community schools. The John W. Gardner Center will host and facilitate a series of three convenings for such organizations in the Bay Area. Participating intermediary organizations will emerge with a renewed sense of organizational purpose and role in the Bay Area community schools landscape; a framework for an overall system of technical assistance, advocacy and support available to community schools seeking assistance; and an understanding of how they might offer learning opportunities similar to these academies for other groups of community schools in the future.</p>
