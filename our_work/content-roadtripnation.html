<p>The Roadtrip Nation Experience was launched in 2008 to empower high school and college students to explore pathways and opportunities for their futures. The specific goals of the program are:</p>

<br>
<ol>

<li> Increase relevance in students' educational experience by connecting them to the real world via experiential learning and engaging multimedia content.</li>

<li> Expand students' social capital and increase exposure to pathways that relate to their individual passions and interests.</li>

<li> Develop students' 21st Century skills through a curriculum that guides the development of skills related to research, project management, teamwork, leadership, technology, and communication.</li>

</ol>
<br>
<p>The Roadtrip Nation Experience curriculum consists of 12 online multimedia lessons, access to the web-based Roadtrip Nation Interview Archive, companion workbook activities, guided classroom discussions, and a culminating Roadtrip Project in which students work in groups to identify and interview leaders in their own communities.</p>

<br>

<p>Roadtrip Nation as approached the Gardner Center to study the implementation of the program at six San Jose Unified School District (SJUSD) Plus schools. The Plus program, one of the alternative learning options offered by the district, employs a school-within-a-school design to serve students who have grade-level abilities yet have been unsuccessful at the comprehensive high school and thus are credit deficient. The program's goal is for students to graduate with their home high school class. A large proportion of students in the Plus program are economically disadvantaged and face numerous obstacles to their educational success.</p>

<br>

<p>The specific research questions guiding the Gardner Center's mixed-methods implementation study are:</p>

<br>
<ol>

<li>In what ways does participation in the Roadtrip Nation Experience shape students' self-efficacy, mastery orientation, and possible selves?</li>

<li>What Elements of Roadtrip Nation Experience are essential to the results of the program?</li>

<li>What are program implementation experiences at the different sites? Does implementation at sites new to the program differ from that seen at the more mature sites?</li>

<li>What obstacles or roadblocks exist that hinder successful implementation? What types of supports can help surmount those?</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>The results of the implementation study will serve to inform ongoing program improvement and plans for expansion to make Roadtrip Nation available to a larger number of settings and students.</p>
