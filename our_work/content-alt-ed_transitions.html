<p>California’s high school dropouts are estimated to cost the state billions of dollars over their lifetimes by lowering tax revenues and increasing payments towards welfare, medical care, and incarceration services. Before dropping out, many students enroll in alternative education schools, which aim to increase the likelihood of a successful transition to adulthood by offering individualized instruction in a smaller classroom environment. Alternative schools include continuation schools, which are generally long-term placements for students working towards a high school diploma, and community schools, which are generally short-term placements for students with expulsion or juvenile probation histories.</p>

 <p>Students in San Mateo County’s Sequoia Union High School District (SUHSD) who have problems with poor academics or behavior frequently enroll in community schools administered by the San Mateo County Office of Education (SMCOE). This brief studied the pathways of “transitioners”: students who left SMCOE’s court and community schools and transitioned into SUHSD’s comprehensive high schools. Our analysis showed that readily available data helped identify which students, particularly ninth grade students dealing with the difficult adjustment from middle school to high school and those with weak attendance and course credit histories, might lack the necessary structure in their lives to successfully transition into a comprehensive high school environment. Key predictors of student success were presented so that SUHSD and SMCOE could better monitor and provide support to these high-risk students.</p>
