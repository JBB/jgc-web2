<p>In 2009, representatives from five community-based organizations in East Palo Alto and Belle Haven identified a need to centralize information on the wide array of programs and services available to youth in the community.  This group of community leaders partnered with the JGC to collect data and use the data to understand gaps or duplication in available services as well as factors that keep youth from accessing the available opportunities.  The JGC created a map that included information on program content, times, target audiences, and costs.  The JGC also engaged youth researchers who surveyed their peers to understand where youth spend their time, what keeps them from accessing programs, and what types of programs they want and need.  The project also included GIS-based analysis of transit lines, crime data, and program locations to understand how these logistical factors could potentially hinder or facilitate youth access to programs.</p>

 <br>

Results of this project include:<br>

<ul>
<li>     An online program mapping tool that allows users to search for programs by time, content, location, or age range;</li>

<li>      A youth research project that introduced community members to the mapping tool and gathered feedback on how to improve usability of the tool; and</li>

<li>      Use of the data and analysis findings in program and community planning discussions.</li>
</ul>
