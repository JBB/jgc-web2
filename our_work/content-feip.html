<p>Through its Family Engagement Impact Project (FEIP), the Heising-Simons Foundation aims to improve educational outcomes for low-income immigrant children in Santa Clara and San Mateo Counties by increasing family engagement.</p> 
<br>
<p>The goal of Phase I of the FEIP is to develop a plan to coordinate family engagement programming across age groups, grades, community-based organizations, schools, and systems.  The Gardner Center’s role is to design and conduct a needs assessment in six selected partner communities within Pescadero, Redwood City, San Jose, and Sunnyvale. Consisting of surveys with parents and providers, this needs assessment will highlight the existing resource landscape for high-need families with children ages 0-8.</p>  
<br>
<p>The needs assessment will focus on the following four areas of inquiry: 1) local family demographics, needs, and strengths; 2) local family engagement practices and perceptions; 3) existing family engagement programs, practices, and resources in each community; and 4) coordination and services related to transitions (e.g. preschool to Kindergarten). We designed the surveys in consultation with residents of each of the six communities to reflect their unique concerns, and copies were made available in multiple languages so as to be broadly accessible to a range of parents.</p>
<br>
<p>The Gardner Center will present our findings to the six partner communities, including a summary of the data across sites and brief individual reports that emphasize local findings.  The Gardner Center will partner with these communities in interpreting the data and help them to identify actionable findings to inform both current and future work.</p>
