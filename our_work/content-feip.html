<p>Through its Family Engagement Impact Project (FEIP), the Heising-Simons Foundation aims to improve educational outcomes for low-income immigrant children in six selected communities within Santa Clara and San Mateo Counties by increasing family engagement at the community level.  The goal of FEIP is to strengthen partnerships to focus on better coordinating and integrating family engagement efforts across multiple organizations and constituencies.</p>
<br>
<p>To support the year-one planning phase of this project, the Gardner Center is designing and conducting a needs assessment in each of the six communities for high-need families with children ages 0-8.  With the goal of mapping family needs and existing resources in each community, the Gardner Center developed a two-pronged approach including (1) interviews with lead agencies; and (2) surveys for parents and providers.  We designed the surveys in consultation with lead agencies in each of the six communities to reflect their unique concerns. Versions of the family survey were made available in multiple languages so as to be broadly accessible to a range of parents.  Over 900 people across Santa Clara and San Mateo Counties participated in these surveys.</p>
<br>
<p>The Gardner Center will present our research to the lead agencies in a report summarizing the data and emphasizing local findings for each community. The Gardner Center will work alongside these agencies to interpret the data and identify actionable findings to inform each communityâ€™s planning for the implementation phase of the project.</p>
