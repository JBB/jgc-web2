 <br>

<p>Dependent youth—those placed under custody of the court due to parental abuse or neglect—face many educational challenges.  First, changes in placements may cause disruptions in schooling that can hurt educational attainment.  Additionally, evidence suggests that a variety of factors, such as the stress of court appearances, separation from siblings and parents, the stigma associated with being in foster care, and trauma from the abuse or neglect that led to removal from the parents’ custody detract from students’ ability to concentrate on school work and can lead to behavioral problems.  Although there is limited research on school experiences for dependent youth, the existing research shows that outcomes are expectedly poor given the difficulties dependent youth face.   The lack of research on educational outcomes for dependent youth stems from the fact that tracking these educational outcomes is complicated due to frequent changes in placements and schools for youth in the foster care system and inconsistent procedures for sharing records across agencies when placement changes occur.</p>

<br>

<p>Given this backdrop, representatives from several San Mateo County youth-serving agencies, including Advocates for Children, the San Mateo County Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) program; Human Services Agency; delinquency and dependency court; philanthropic foundations; and community college district formed a committee to identify strategies for improving the educational success of the court-dependent youth that they collectively serve.  This group asked the John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities (JGC) at Stanford University to analyze educational outcomes for the dependent youth in the County.  In partnership with the SPHERE Institute, the JGC operates the Youth Data Archive (YDA), an initiative that links data across youth-serving agencies to answer questions that those agencies could not answer working independently.  For this analysis, we used the YDA to link dependency records from the Child Welfare Services (CWS) to educational data from several school districts to examine the relationship between dependency and school outcomes. </p>

<br>

<p>JGC and SPHERE researchers linked CWS records on types, durations, and numbers of placements for dependent youth to school achievement, attendance, and discipline data from four participating educational systems in San Mateo County.  Using this matched data set, we produced cross-sectional statistics that examine outcomes for dependent youth in four county school districts—including those removed from their homes and put in an out-of-home foster placement as well as those remaining in or returned to their home while under court custody—who ever enrolled in elementary through high school at a partnering district between the 2003-04 and 2007-08 academic years.  In addition to comparing outcomes of dependent youth to other youth enrolled in these districts, this analysis examines differences in outcomes among dependent youth by their dependency characteristics, such as type, duration, and number of placements over time.</p>
