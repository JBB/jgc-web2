<span class="content-bold">Research Topic </span>

<br>

<p> At the request of the Redwood City 2020 Truancy Committee, the John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities (JGC) began an analysis to study truancy and early chronic absenteeism among Redwood City students.  Through the Youth Data Archive (YDA), the JGC has linked data from Redwood City School District (RCSD), Sequoia Union High School District (SUHSD), and the San Mateo County Human Services Agency to examine the extent to which truancy and early chronic absenteeism are present in the greater Redwood City area. This project also explores the causes, consequences, and correlates of these issues that may be present in the community. Findings from these investigations may help schools and the community to take action to assist students who are truant or chronically absent in the greater Redwood City area. </p>

<span class="content-bold">Key Research Questions </span>

<br>

<p> As the existing body of research emphasizes the deleterious effects of truancy and early chronic absenteeism, it is important for us to find out more about the extent of these twin problems in the local community. The analysis focuses on two questions: </p>

<br>

<p>1.  What is the extent of the problem:  How many and what percent of students are chronically absent or truant? </p>

<ul>

<li> What are the demographic characteristics of these students? </li>

<li> How has the arc of the problem changed over time?  </li>

</ul>

<br>

<p>2.  In what ways does this affect students: What are the causes and consequences of truancy and chronic absenteeism in the local area?  </p>

<ul>

<li> What demographic characteristics and other factors are correlated with studentsâ€™ truancy and chronic absenteeism? </li>

<li> What are longitudinal outcomes for students with truancy or chronic absenteeism problems? </li>

<li> What interventions exist to assist these students? </li>

</ul>
