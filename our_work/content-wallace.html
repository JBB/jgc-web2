<p>In a typical city, many community-based organizations are working diligently to provide out-of-school time programming to resident children and youth.  However, because these organizations undertake their efforts separately, it is more difficult to leverage collective expertise around resources to work toward the common goal of enhancing OST across their city to benefit children, youth, and families. A citywide, coordinated approach provides an opportunity for these community-based organizations  to  build their capacity to plan, set priorities, and collect and analyze information. As a result of this shared vision, organizations can better meet the needs of their community’s children and youth.</p>
<br>
<p>In 2003, the Wallace Foundation began working in five cities—Boston; Chicago; New York; Providence; and Washington, D.C.—to foster the creation of citywide OST systems that could support better programs and increase youth’s access to them.  In 2012, the Wallace Foundation announced nine “next generation” grants in Baltimore, Denver, Fort Worth, Grand Rapids, Jacksonville, Louisville, Nashville, Philadelphia, and St. Paul in an effort to further develop burgeoning systems in those communities.  The aim of this work is to build the capacity of each city to expand their existing OST systems, with a particular emphasis on attending to (1) program quality; (2) a reliable, integrated, citywide data system; and (3) sustainability with the ultimate goal of improving youth access to and participation in high quality OST programs.</p>
<br>
<p>The Gardner Center is one of four organizations working to inform project implementation and provide technical assistance (e.g., coach and consult with city leaders and leadership collaboratives; develop and conduct web-based support through “office hours,” ongoing seminars, and webinars; participate  in site visits and cross-site convenings) to these nine cities as they do this work. We are partnering with cities to help them develop capacities to collect and use data to support program quality and sustainability. This support includes thinking through their research questions, cultivating partnerships, and applying a youth development lens to the important work of creating citywide linked data systems.</p>
