<p>More than 15 million school-age children are left unattended after the school bell rings, yet millions of parents report they would enroll their children in afterschool and summer programs if only they were available. This represents a missed opportunity for learning and enrichment during out-of-school time (OST), especially for those children most in need.</p>
<br>
<p>In 2003, the Wallace Foundation began working in five cities—Boston; Chicago; New York; Providence; and Washington, D.C.—to foster the creation of citywide OST systems that could support better programs and increase youth’s access to them.  In 2012, the Wallace Foundation announced nine “next generation” grants in Baltimore, Denver, Fort Worth, Grand Rapids, Jacksonville, Louisville, Nashville, Philadelphia, and St. Paul in an effort to further develop burgeoning systems in those communities.  The aim of this work is to build the capacity of each city to expand their existing OST systems, with a particular emphasis on attending to (1) program quality; (2) a reliable, integrated, citywide data system; and (3) sustainability with the ultimate goal of improving youth access to and participation in high quality OST programs.</p>
<br>
<p>The Gardner Center is one of four organizations working to inform project implementation and provide technical assistance (e.g., coach and consult with city leaders and leadership collaboratives; develop and conduct web-based support through “office hours,” ongoing seminars, and webinars; participate  in site visits and cross-site convenings) to these nine cities as they do this work. We are partnering with cities to think through their research questions, cultivate partnerships, and to apply a youth development lens to the important work of creating citywide linked data systems.</p>
