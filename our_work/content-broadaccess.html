<p>Every major metropolitan area hosts a complex ecology of organizations providing higher education services. Over the past 40 years, local colleges have contributed substantially to the economic development of Silicon Valley. To date, researchers studying the contributions of these institutions have focused mainly on selective universities, overlooking the role of broad-access colleges, which admit all or most of students who apply. These broad access colleges—including community colleges, for-profit colleges, open access private colleges, and those in the California State University system—have educated and trained many students to support the Silicon Valley in a variety of fields.</p>
<br>
<p>The study focuses on the processes and mechanisms by which San Francisco Bay Area broad-access colleges have contributed to the production of human capital within Silicon Valley from 1970 to present day. Silicon Valley is renowned for its mix of entrepreneurs, firms, business infrastructure, colleges, and research universities. Here, we are able to examine how networks among key higher education and industry actors, institutional logics, and local and state governance systems have interacted and shifted over time in response to key industry developments and demographic shifts.</p>
<br>
<p>Research questions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How have the numbers and types of colleges in the Bay Area changed from 1970 to 2010?</li>
<li>What are the major changes in the context of these colleges? How have these changes influenced the colleges?</li>
<li>To what extent have broad-access colleges partnered with firms in the Silicon Valley tech economy? How have these partnerships shaped the policies, structures, and practices of broad-access institutions?</li>
<li>What types of labor intermediary organizations are active in the Silicon Valley economy?</li>
<li>How have these organizations responded to the changing demands of the Silicon Valley labor market?</li>
<li>What are implications of this study for a variety of policy stakeholders spanning K-12 and postsecondary education?</li>
<br>
<p>Employing quantitative data, we are tracking changes in numbers and types of colleges, colleges' funding and regulatory policy, and the regional demography in which they sit—and describing and analyzing their interdependencies. We are supplementing this with a set of in-depth case studies focused on different types of broad-access colleges, their networks in industry, and other intermediaries, examining the ways in which relations with Silicon Valley firms have influenced the college—its mission, structures, and programs.</p>
<br>
<p>Through this work, colleges may learn how to improve programs through industry partnerships, firms may understand how to more productively partner with local colleges to meet their human capital needs, and state and local policymakers may gain guidance on how to enhance economic and educational vitality.</p>
