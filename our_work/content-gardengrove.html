<p>With 70 operational schools serving approximately 48,000 students, Garden Grove Unified School District (GGUSD) ranks as the 11th largest district in California and the third largest in Orange County. The district covers roughly 30 miles of territory, serving most of Garden Grove and portions of six neighboring communities—Anaheim, Cypress, Fountain Valley, Santa Ana, and Westminster.  The student population in GGUSD is ethnically diverse, a majority of whom are Latinos (48%), followed by Caucasians (30%), Asians (15%), Filipinos (2%), and African Americans (2%). English is the second language for about 40% of the district’s students, and more than half qualify for subsidized school meals.</p>
<br>
<p>While a strong culture of evidence-based decision making exists in GGUSD, budgetary and human resource constraints have hindered its ability to use data more frequently and on a regular basis. Our partnership helps provide the structure and supports to gather together, examine, and use data to inform change efforts happening at the individual, setting, and system levels. The district has identified two key research questions to guide our work: (1) Are students’ course placements in math predictive of their success in high school, and (2) What kind of classroom- and school-level practices cultivate students’ motivation to learn and engage academically?</p>
<br>
<p>Our partnership with GGUSD broadens the reach of our Youth Data Archive to include Southern California. It also taps into our expertise in the areas of student motivation and academic tenacity, and builds upon a decade of work in diverse communities serving young people who face circumstances and conditions that impede their academic success and healthy development. Our work with the district can help model a community of practice approach in the area, where interested groups (e.g., K-12 schools, community colleges, nonprofits) collaborate to formulate knowledge and strategies that help solve many of the local challenges young people encounter.</p>
