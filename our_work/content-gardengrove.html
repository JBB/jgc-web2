<p> Garden Grove Unified School District (GGUSD) is the 11th largest district in California, with 67 operational schools and approximately 48,000 enrolled students. The student population is ethnically diverse and predominantly low income; nearly half of the students are English Language Learners. While a strong, district-wide culture of evaluative inquiry and practices persists, budgetary and human resources constraints hinder GGUSD's ability to use data regularly and in more efficient ways. Our partnership affords teh structure and supports necessary for GGUSD to examine data for ongoing inquiry, decision making, and reforms aimed at the system (district), setting (classroom), and individual (student) levels.</p>
<br>
GGUSD has identified two key research questions to guide our work:
<br>
<br>
Are students course placements in math predictive of their failure to meet graduation requirements?
<br>
<br>
What kind of classroom- and school-level practices can help cultivate students' motivation to learn and academic engagement?
<br>
<br>
<p>This new partnership is the first to broaden the reach of our Youth Data Archive to include Southern California. It also taps into our expertise in the areas of student motivation and academic tenacity and builds upon a decade of work in diverse communities serving young people facing multiple challenges to their academic success and healthy development. Most importantly, working with GGUSD can model a community of practice approach in Garden Grove, where interested groups (e.g., K-12 schools, community colleges, nonprofits) collaborate on an ongoing basis to identify critical youth-related issues and formulate new knowledge and strategies to tackle challenges that young people encounter.</p>
