           <h1 class="title-page-header-big">Community Youth Development Initiative (CYDI)</h1>

<br>

		<h1 class="content-text-header">About CYDI</h1>

		<p>Launched in the spring of 2008 by Redwood City 2020 (RWC 2020) in partnership with the John W. Gardner Center for Youth
		and Their Communities (JGC) at Stanford University, CYDI brings together over 35 organizations serving the Redwood City 		and North Fair Oaks community to accomplish more for and with youth than they can do alone. Through collaboration, we 			work to promote shared responsibility across different sectors of our community for all our youth so that they grow up 			with the knowledge, skills, and social attributes they need for success in school, work and life. As a network of 			partners, we aim to achieve the following outcomes by 2020:</p>
<br>

<ol>

<li>The Redwood City community works with youth as partners in improving the health and well-being of all people.</li>

<li>Youth have the knowledge, resources and self-confidence to pursue their passions and reach their goals.</li>

<li>Adults and youth develop trusting relationships and work together to improve their community.</li>

<li>Parents and caregivers have the knowledge, resources and self-confidence to participate in the community and

improve their quality of life.</li>

<li>Community youth serving organizations continually improve their efforts to provide quality experiences for youth.</li>

<li>Mutually beneficial collaborations among organizations and institutions benefit all members of the community – from

youth to seniors.</li>

</ol>

<br>

<h1 class="content-text-header">Our Approach</h1>

<p>Whether our partners work in the area of teen pregnancy or alcohol and other drug prevention, after school, intervention,

treatment or aftercare, our efforts focus on working together to apply effective youth development practices across youth

programs and throughout the community so that all youth experience positive and meaningful opportunities to learn, grow and

contribute. Towards that end, we have adopted the following set of overarching strategies:</p>

<br>

<ul>

<li>Build relationships to work towards a shared vision and common outcomes. </li>

<li>Create an inclusive learning community that fosters effective youth development practices. </li>

<li>Cultivate youth and community involvement and leadership. </li>

<li>Use youth data to identify needs and track progress. </li>

<li>Foster collaboration among organizations to promote creative thinking and leverage resources. </li>

</ul>

<br>

<h1 class="content-text-header">Opportunities for Involvement</h1>

<p>CYDI partners have many opportunities to be involved in a variety of activities through the year, including networking,

professional growth and working in partnership with youth.
