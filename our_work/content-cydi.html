           <h1 class="title-page-header-big">Community Youth Development Initiative (CYDI)</h1>

<br>

		<h1 class="content-text-header">About CYDI</h1>

		<p>Launched in the spring of 2008 by Redwood City 2020 (RWC 2020) in partnership with the John W. Gardner Center for Youth
		and Their Communities (JGC) at Stanford University, CYDI brings together over 35 organizations serving the Redwood City 		and North Fair Oaks community to accomplish more for and with youth than they can do alone. Through collaboration, we 			work to promote shared responsibility across different sectors of our community for all our youth so that they grow up 			with the knowledge, skills, and social attributes they need for success in school, work and life. As a network of 			partners, we aim to achieve the following outcomes by 2020:</p>
<br>

<ol>

<li>The Redwood City community works with youth as partners in improving the health and well-being of all people.</li>

<li>Youth have the knowledge, resources and self-confidence to pursue their passions and reach their goals.</li>

<li>Adults and youth develop trusting relationships and work together to improve their community.</li>

<li>Parents and caregivers have the knowledge, resources and self-confidence to participate in the community and

improve their quality of life.</li>

<li>Community youth serving organizations continually improve their efforts to provide quality experiences for youth.</li>

<li>Mutually beneficial collaborations among organizations and institutions benefit all members of the community – from

youth to seniors.</li>

</ol>

<br>

<h1 class="content-text-header">Our Approach</h1>

<p>Whether our partners work in the area of teen pregnancy or alcohol and other drug prevention, after school, intervention,

treatment or aftercare, our efforts focus on working together to apply effective youth development practices across youth

programs and throughout the community so that all youth experience positive and meaningful opportunities to learn, grow and

contribute. Towards that end, we have adopted the following set of overarching strategies:</p>

<br>

<ul>

<li>Build relationships to work towards a shared vision and common outcomes. </li>

<li>Create an inclusive learning community that fosters effective youth development practices. </li>

<li>Cultivate youth and community involvement and leadership. </li>

<li>Use youth data to identify needs and track progress. </li>

<li>Foster collaboration among organizations to promote creative thinking and leverage resources. </li>

</ul>

<br>

<h1 class="content-text-header">Opportunities for Involvement</h1>

<p>CYDI partners have many opportunities to be involved in a variety of activities through the year, including networking,

professional growth and working in partnership with youth.</p>

<br>

<span class="content-bold">Action Teams</span><br>

<p>The majority of our collaborative work brings organizational and community leaders together to address issues of mutual

concern. A core of dedicated community partners spearheads the following action teams:</p>

<ul>

<li>Immigrant Youth Action Team (IYAT) – this youth-adult partnership team works to increase the visibility, actions, and

resources for immigrant youth in our community through a variety of events, presentations and advocacy. </li>

<li>Professional Development Action Team – this team of youth service providers works to weave their collective

resources to support adults working with youth in our community by identifying and sharing tools and resources. </li>

<li>Teens in Action Showcase – In partnership with Redwood City 2020’s Prevention Partnership, this annual spring

event seeks to support and highlight the work, passions and contributions of youth across our community. </li>

<li>Pride and Education/Orgullo y Educación (OYE) – This new ad-hoc team of youth and adults aims to promote the

integration and educational, social and cultural success of youth from Redwood City and North Fair Oaks as a way of

strengthening our community as a whole. This team hosts an annual fall conference for Latina/o youth. </li>

</ul>

<br>

<span class="content-bold">Partner Convenings</span><br>

<p>Convenings of organizational partners are hosted by

Redwood City 2020 one to two times per year. Each partner

organization commits to participate in these gatherings to

learn from each other, stay updated on progress, and provide

mutual support.</p>

<br>
<span class="content-bold">Professional Development</span><br>

<p>CYDI provides opportunities in the community for partners to

take part in a number of youth development professional

development and learning experiences with other

organizations throughout the year.</p>

<br>
<span class="content-bold">Communication and Information Sharing</span><br>

<p>With a network of over 150 individuals working with and for

youth in our community, CYDI serves as a conduit for

promoting the exchange of information about resources,

opportunities and success stories among our partners. All

partners are invited and encouraged to share news and

resources through our newsletters and website updates.</p>

<br>
<h1 class="content-text-header">Accountability</h1>

<p>All CYDI partners make annual commitments to advance our

shared outcomes by implementing core services, supports

and opportunities within their organizations. Every year,

partners also participate in an annual survey administered by

the JGC that tracks our progress through key indicators

related to our outcomes. A Steering Committee composed of

the action team conveners meets quarterly to coordinate key

activities. Annual presentations to report on our progress are

made to RWC 2020’s Coordinating Council, which serve as

opportunities for organizational and community leaders to

discuss critical accomplishments and challenges with local

elected and appointed policy makers.</p>

<br>

<h1 class="content-text-header">Join Us!</h1>

<p>The scope of this initiative in promoting youth development as

a key strategy across a variety of RWC 2020 initiatives is

broad and ambitious, but our young people and our

community members deserve nothing less. We need help to

sustain momentum and focus over time. But the skills,

resources and commitment of our CYDI partners and our

broader community give us reason to be positive about our

chances for success.</p>
