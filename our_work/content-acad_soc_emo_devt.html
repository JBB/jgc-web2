<h1 class="title-page-header-big">Connecting Academic with Social and Emotional Development</h1>
<br>
     <p>The project, funded by the Hewlett Foundation, focuses on deeper learning competencies, expanding these concepts in two content areas with two short white papers that include a common conceptual framework. </p>
<br>
 

<p>We first consider the role of social and emotional development in academic learning.  Young people must develop in four main domains to successfully navigate their transition to productive adulthood: physical, intellectual, psychological/ emotional, and social.  Research has found that these domains develop together.  For instance, social and emotional learning are tied to students’ school attitudes, behavior, but there is less research on in-school contexts that support social and emotional development than out-of-school contexts. Understanding these features and their role in content and strategy learning in school is the main focus of this review.  We will also identify tools that can be used to validly and reliably measure social and emotional development in the school context. </p>

 <br>

<p>Second, we focus on how the concepts of domain-specific content knowledge and strategic knowledge – also referred to as transfer of learning – apply to the deeper learning competencies. Research shows that competencies and skills students develop in school do not operate in isolation; rather, in order to transfer factual information to useable knowledge, students must learn with a deep understanding of the material that is scaffolded by an embedded context and an organizational system that allows for retrieval.  Mastering core academic content both depends on and enhances the other four competencies, which are more strategic in nature. It is therefore important to examine these deeper learning competencies in a framework that allows for the interconnectedness among them.</p>
