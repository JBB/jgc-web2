<p>Since 2009, the JGC has worked in partnership with the Redwood City School District to better understand middle school students’ classroom experiences. 
 In particular, this study focuses on students’ perceptions of classroom practices in relation to their motivational beliefs, engagement and achievement outcomes.  
Over the past three years, JGC researchers have collected survey data from all middle school students in the Redwood City School District.  
These surveys ask students about their perceptions of caring practices in the classroom as well as practices that encourage students to put forth effort and take on academic challenges.  In addition, surveys include questions about students’ own motivational beliefs and goals and the extent to which they are engaged in their learning. Students’ responses are linked to their school records and administrative data through the Youth Data Archive.  
Findings from our analyses are shared with administrators and practitioners in the school district through presentations, conversations and publications.  
 Through our conversations with teachers, principals and administrators we are able to refine and refocus our questions to ensure that our analyses continue to be relevant and meaningful to our community partners.</p>
