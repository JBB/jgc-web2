<p>Since 2007, the John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities (JGC) at Stanford University, Redwood City School District (RCSD), and Redwood City 2020 (RWC 2020) have partnered to conduct research on participation and outcomes for students in the RCSD community schools.  This analysis focuses on examining both patterns of participation in the programs offered at community schools as well as outcomes related to participation in those programs.  The framework for examining short-term and long-term outcomes is defined by a community schools logic model developed by RCSD. </p>

<br>

 

<p>This research utilizes the Youth Data Archive (YDA), a JGC initiative that links data on individual students collected by multiple agencies in order to ask and answer questions that would not be possible to answer by any single agency alone.  In this case, we matched data from the following data sources:<p>

<br>

<ul>

<li>Administrative data from RCSD that includes student demographic information, achievement, and school attendance;</li>

<li>Participation records in community school programs collected by the schools and service providers at the schools; </li>

<li>Survey data on student motivation and their experiences in school collected by JGC staff for all middle school students in RCSD; and</li>

<li>Survey data on studentsâ€™ motivation and experiences in after school programs, collected by after school program providers at each school. </li>

</ul>
