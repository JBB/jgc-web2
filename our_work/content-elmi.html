<p>Research shows that early math skills are highly predictive of student achievement in later grades in both math and reading. This holds true even after controlling for a number of student characteristics, including cognitive, attention, and socio-emotional skills, as well as family background.  As such, the Gardner Center is partnering with the San Mateo County Office of Education (SMCOE) and the Redwood City School District (RCSD) to study the implementation of the Heising-Simons Foundation’s Early Learning Mathematics Initiative (ELMI). During the 2013-14 school year, the initiative aims to improve the math achievement of RCSD students in pre-Kindergarten through third grade (PK-3) at two community school sites: Fair Oaks Elementary School and Garfield Elementary School.</p>
<br>
<p>To do this, ELMI is supporting all PK-3 teachers at both school sites via professional development and coaching support in early math education.  Additionally, ELMI aims to enhance the strength and sustainability of existing professional learning communities focused on improving students’ math achievement. Overall, ELMI is serving 46 adult participants in RCSD, including teachers, instructional aides, site administrators, and district coaches. The teachers in this cohort are serving over 800 students in their classrooms in the 2013-14 school year.</p>
<br>
<p>Through interviews with teachers and administrators, a teacher survey, and classroom observation, the Gardner Center’s ELMI implementation study will inform SMCOE, RCSD, and the Heising-Simons Foundation about:<p>
<br>
<li>participants’ experiences with ELMI training and support,</li>
<br>
<li>shifts in teachers’ math content knowledge and classroom instructional practices associated with participation in ELMI, and</li>
<br>
<li>the nature of participants’ collaboration in ELMI professional learning communities.</li>
<br>
<p>In addition, the Gardner Center will examine and report on the performance of students attending ELMI classrooms on assessments of math content knowledge. The findings from our implementation study will serve to fine-tune ELMI in order to more effectively provide essential support to educators who teach math in the early grades.</li>
