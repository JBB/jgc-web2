"For men and women who have accepted the reality of change, the need for endless learning and trying is a way of living, a way of thinking, a way of being awake and ready. Life isn't a train ride where you choose your destination, pay your fare, and settle back for a nap. It's a cycle ride over uncertain terrain, with you in the driver's seat, constantly correcting your balance and determining the direction of progress. It's difficult, sometimes profoundly painful. But it is better than napping through life." - John W. Gardner, Self-Renewal [1964]

<p>This Gardner Center study focuses on the processes and mechanisms by which San Francisco Bay Area broad-access colleges have contributed to the production of human capital within Silicon Valley from 1970 to present day. Silicon Valley is renowned for its mix of entrepreneurs, firms, business infrastructure, colleges, and research universities. Here, we are able to examine how networks among key higher education and industry actors, institutional logics, and local and state governance systems have interacted and shifted over time in response to key industry developments and demographic shifts.</p>
Published 50 years ago this year, John W. Gardner.s Self-Renewal: The Individual and the Innovative Society continues to counsel and motivate those brave individuals who strive to remain enlivened in a world where people, the institutions they represent, and the societies they populate are at constant risk of apathy and decay. In Self-Renewal, Gardner writes that .no society is likely to renew itself unless its dominant orientation is to the future.. This focus on the future, on youth, and on educating for renewal is particularly meaningful to our work at the John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities.
<br><br>

         The Call of Service: A Witness to Idealism by Robert Coles (1993)
       </span>
       <br><br>
       Harvard professor and child psychiatrist Robert Coles learned about volunteerism from such big names as Dorothy Day, Anna Freud, and William Carlos Williams. This empathic book interweaves the author.s own experience with accounts from dozens of interviews he conducted on particularly .John Gardner-esque. topic: volunteerism and the call to serve. A theme across these stories is the idea that service is about reciprocity: in giving we are bound to receive, just as in teaching we.re bound to learn. Twenty years after its first publication, I was impressed by this book.s enduring message. [K.D.]
