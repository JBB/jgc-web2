<p> At the request of partners in the Youth Data Archive (YDA), the John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities are updating an analysis done in 2010 linking data from youth who participated in the San Mateo County Office of Education (SMCOE) Preschool for All (PFA) program and enrolled in Redwood City School District (RCSD) thereafter.  The 2010 YDA report followed PFA participants through the end of kindergarten, 1st, and 2nd grade to see how closely PFA trajectories follow those of other RCSD students. The updated report will be able to strengthen the results for PFA participants in 1st and 2nd grade, and follow one cohort into 3rd grade. </p>

<br>

<p> The 2010 report showed that, before controlling for demographic background characteristics, PFA-enrolled students achieved Kindergarten outcomes below that of their non-PFA peers. The updated analysis will examine whether PFA-enrolled students achieve similar levels of school performance in 1st grade compared to their peers, and whether that is maintained over time. </p>
