<p> At the request of partners in the Youth Data Archive (YDA), the John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities (JGC) have conducted two analyses examining academic outcomes for San Mateo County Preschool for All (PFA) participants who went on to attend elementary school in Redwood City School District (RCSD). The 2011 study found that students who attended PFA had lower report card proficiency rates than their non-PFA peers in kindergarten, first, and second grade. However, after adjusting for students’ demographic background characteristics, PFA participants’ report card proficiency rates were similar to – and sometimes higher than – non-participants'.  The study also found that children who attended two years of PFA had higher adjusted proficiency rates in many early elementary report card subjects compared to children who did not attend PFA.

<br>
The 2012 study strengthened this work by including more students in the analysis and by examining second graders’ outcomes on standardized tests.  The updated analysis supports the 2011 findings on student report card proficiency and finds similar patterns for second graders on standardized tests. </p>
