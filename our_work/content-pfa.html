<span class="content-bold"> Research Topic: </span><br>

<p> At the request of partners in the Youth Data Archive (YDA), the John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities are updating an analysis done in 2010 linking data from youth who participated in the San Mateo County Office of Education (SMCOE) Preschool for All (PFA) program and enrolled in Redwood City School District (RCSD) thereafter.  The 2010 YDA report followed PFA participants through the end of kindergarten, 1st, and 2nd grade to see how closely PFA trajectories follow those of other RCSD students. The updated report will be able to strengthen the results for PFA participants in 1st and 2nd grade, and follow one cohort into 3rd grade. </p>

<br>

<p> The 2010 report showed that, before controlling for demographic background characteristics, PFA-enrolled students achieved Kindergarten outcomes below that of their non-PFA peers. The updated analysis will examine whether PFA-enrolled students achieve similar levels of school performance in 1st grade compared to their peers, and whether that is maintained over time. </p>

<br>

<span class="content-bold">Description of Analysis and Research Questions: </span><br>

<p> This work will strengthen the prior analysis that examined school-based outcomes for PFA participants, including academic achievement, discipline, and attendance in kindergarten through second grades.  It will also enable a cursory examination of one cohort of PFA participant outcomes into third grade.  The specific research questions are: </p>

<br>

1.  What is the performance of PFA participants on RCSDâ€™s first through third grade progress reports and standardized tests? 

<br>

<ul>

<li> How does PFA participant performance differ across variables such as child and family demographics, special needs diagnosis, English language learner status, PFA dosage and other factors? </li>

<li> How do PFA participants compare to other children not in PFA, the majority of whom were involved in some form of preschool? </li>

</ul>

<br>

2. Are there additional factors that are associated with stronger long-term outcomes for PFA participants?

<br>

<ul

<li>PFA children who attend the program for one year at age four compared to PFA children who attend for two years at age three and four </li>

<li> PFA children who enter community schools as compared to PFA children who go to other schools in RCSD </li>

</ul>
