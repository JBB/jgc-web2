<h1 class="content-text-header">Implementation of Playworks in Eight Bay Area Schools</h1>
<p>With funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, JGC conducted a qualitative study of the implementation of Playworks at eight Bay Area schools. Playworks is a national recess-based program that incorporates positive youth development themes and physical activity to improve the quality of play and conflict resolution during recess so that students can re-enter class ready to learn. The study documented the school contexts and Playworks practices that led to high quality implementation across schools and discussed the challenges that schools faced in implementing the program.</p>

<h1 class="content-text-header">Randomized Control Trial of Playworks</h1>
<p>With partner institution Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. and funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the JGC is conducting a randomized control trial of Playworks in 32 schools nationally.  Playworks is a national recess-based program that incorporates positive youth development themes and physical activity to improve the quality of play and conflict resolution during recess so that students can re-enter class ready to learn. JGC is responsible for the implementation study, examining the implementation of the program in Playworks schools as well as documenting the quality of recess at control schools.  The study also examines the impact of the program on a variety of outcomes, including studentsâ€™ physical activity levels, their academic outcomes, and youth development practices and outcomes.</p>
