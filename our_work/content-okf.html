<p>Oakland Kids First (OKF) is an organization with more than a decade-long commitment to creating meaningful leadership opportunities for young people to transform their schools and communities so all youth graduate with the skills and motivation to reach their dreams. In 2005, OKF youth leaders initiated and created PASS-2, a peer academic support program designed to provide needed support for entering high school students by tapping older students as peer educators and mentors. The goal of the program is two-fold: to improve academic achievement of all student participants and to promote a school culture that fosters positive youth development, including meaningful youth engagement, positive relationships, and a culture of academic success. </p>

<br>

<p>In order to inform ongoing program improvement and expansion, OKF has contracted the John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities at Stanford University to study the implementation process of PASS-2 in three Oakland high schools during the 2011-2012 academic year. A few interviews and observations will also be conducted in three additional Oakland high schools (“non-target sites”) to complement the deeper work being done at the primary research sites. </p>

<br>

<p>This research has been designed with the intention of better understanding: (1) the conditions and variables that support and hinder the implementation of PASS-2 in different school settings, and (2) the ways in which students and adults are experiencing PASS-2. The specific questions guiding this study include: </p>

<br>

<ol>

<li> What is OKF's Theory of Change (in which PASS-2 is embedded)? What is the PASS-2 Theory of Change? </li>

<li> In what ways do 9th and 12th grade participants experience improved peer relationships, increased sense of responsibility towards peers, increased academic achievement, increased motivation, and improved capacity (knowledge, skills, practice) to serve as a leader? </li>

<li> In what ways does PASS-2 affect school personnel? </li>

<li> In what ways does PASS-2 affect school climate overall? </li>

<li> In what ways does PASS-2 implementation vary across three sites and what factors contribute to this variation? </li>

</ol>
