<p>In 2010, the Pittsburgh Public Schools (PPS) district established the Summer Dreamers Academy (SDA).  The program is a free, five-week summer literacy camp for rising 6th through 8th grade students. This summer program is part of the district’s efforts to make sure that all youth are eligible for the Pittsburgh Promise, a scholarship program available to PPS graduates who attend college in Pennsylvania.</p>
<br>
<p>In partnership with the Pittsburgh Public Schools Office of Strategic Initiatives that runs the program, The National Summer Learning Association is conducting a mixed methods evaluation Summer Dreamers Academy across two summers. The evaluation is designed around eight questions based on the program logic model and design, calling on data sources including a review of program documents and materials, onsite observations and interviews, stakeholder surveys and focus groups, demographic data, participation and attendance data, behavioral referrals, and indicators of academic progress.
JGC researchers are participating in the evaluation efforts as consultants.  We helped develop surveys administered to teachers and campers that ask about youth development and motivational practices and beliefs.  Our team is analyzing that data and working with the Pittsburgh-based staff to better understand the relationship between practices in the program and students’ motivational beliefs and achievement outcomes.</p>
