<span class="content-bold">Overview</span>
<p>Since 2008, the John W. Gardner Center (JGC) at Stanford University, in partnership with Redwood City School District (RCSD) and Redwood City 2020 (RC2020), has been conducting a quantitative study to understand the benefits of student participation in community school programming.  Recently, JGC analyses of school district data have highlighted the importance of family engagement.  Our research has shown that students whose parents participate in community school programming are more likely to show achievement gains. At the request of RCSD and RC2020, JGC will conduct a companion study during the 2011-2012 school year using qualitative data to deepen our understanding of family engagement within and across four Redwood City community schools.</p>
<br>

<span class="content-bold">Goals of the Study</span>
<p>This qualitative study seeks to learn more about family engagement from multiple perspectives.  Through interviews with parents, students and school-based staff, we will be focusing on the process of engaging families in the context of a community school.  Findings from this study are expected to inform and improve efforts to support students and their families.</p>
<br>
<span class="content-bold">Data Collection</span>
<p>Between January 2012 and March 2012, JGC researchers will collect data through a series of interviews and focus groups at each of the five RCSD community schools (Kennedy, Hoover, Taft, Garfield and Fair Oaks).  JGC will work closely with the Director of School-Community Partnerships and the Community School Coordinators to schedule the following data collection activities at each school:</p>
<br>  

<ol>
<li>Individual Interviews</li>
<ul>
<li>Community School Coordinator</li>
<li>Principal</li>
<li>Teachers </li>
<li>Staff from on-site family engagement programs</li> 
</ul>
<br>
<li>Focus Groups</li>
<ul>
<li>Parents (2 groups of  6-8 parents)</li>
<li>Students (2 groups of  6-8 students)</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<br>
<span class="content-bold">Data Analysis and Reporting</span>
<p>Qualitative data analysis will be conducted in spring/summer 2012.  All findings will be reported in the aggregate and no individuals or schools will be identified.  A final report will be shared with school district and community school staff in fall 2012.</p>
