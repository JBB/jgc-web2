<br>
 

<p>With the generous support of the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr. Fund, the John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities (JGC) at Stanford University has launched the San Francisco Research Consortium (SFRC).  The consortium enhances current school reform research by creating a research and community collaborative to identify and investigate key issues intended to improve students’ educational outcomes.  Modeled in part on the Consortium for Chicago School Research at the University of Chicago, the SFRC will initially be a partnership among Stanford University School of Education researchers, the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD), City College of San Francisco (CCSF), and the San Francisco Mayor’s Office.  The main goal of the SFRC is to develop cross-institutional relationships that enable collaborative research leading to improved policies, practices and outcomes for the youth, teachers and schools of San Francisco.</p>
