<p>Since 2010, a group of youth and adult community members from East Palo Alto have worked with the John W. Gardner Center (JGC) and an anonymous funder to determine if people in East Palo Alto want and need a community-based Arts, Music and Cultural Center. Staff and members of local organizations including Live in Peace (LIP), the Mural Music & Arts Project (MMAP), and Youth United for Community Action (YUCA) serve as core planning team members. Youth leaders from the team have conducted two rounds of data collection and community engagement for the purpose of learning about local interests, needs, potential locations, and political and socialwill for the project.</p>
