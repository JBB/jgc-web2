<p>In 2010, ten Youth Arts Researchers (YARs) worked with the John W. Gardner Center (JGC) to determine if members of the East Palo Alto community wanted and needed a new Youth Art and Music Center.  The YARs were between 15 and 23 years of age, all from the East Palo Alto community. Two community-based organizations - Live in Peace (LIP) and the Mural Music and Arts Project (MMAP) - identified the participating youth, who each received a stipend for their work, along with training in research design and implementation. The youth interviewed 95 people, conducted site visits to other centers, and synthesized research findings and recommendations. The findings indicated that such a center would be strongly supported by residents and that it would be an asset to the East Palo Alto community. </p>

<br>

<p>Youth and adult partners are currently engaged in the second phase of work: discussing initial findings with youth, policy makers and social leaders, with the aim of gathering additional guidance and identifying key partnerships, design principles, and next steps for forward movement. </p>  

<br>

<p>Specifically, the current youth and adult team aims to develop:</p>

<br>

 

<ol>

<li>An assessment of barriers and opportunities for creating and sustaining a Youth Art and Music Center in EPA.</li>

<li>Engaged community “champions” to help move the project forward; </li>

<li>A set of recommendations for planning a thriving, sustainable Youth Art and Music Center in EPA, including the financial model, program features, partnership structure, and ongoing community engagement strategies; and</li>

<li>Agreement with project funders, community decision makers and champions regarding next steps in project funding and development. </li>

</ol>
