<p><span class="content-italic">Soccer for Success</span> is a U.S. Soccer Foundation after‐school program that uses soccer to promote positive outcomes for children in low‐income urban communities. This study focused on <span class="content-italic">Soccer for Success</span> as implemented by the United Soccer Club (USC), the organization that runs <span class="content-italic">Soccer for Success</span> in Washington, DC. The research aimed to understand how the program is implemented and to uncover key conditions that facilitate or hinder the program’s ability to reach its goals. It employed a mixed methods design, including observations, interviews, focus group interviews, and student surveys, as well as specific measures of student outcomes. The findings provide preliminary evidence that <span class="content-italic">Soccer for Success</span> is an effective approach to addressing childhood obesity and juvenile delinquency among disadvantaged children in urban communities – communities deeply impacted by poverty and characterized by a scarcity of quality programs and services that promote the well‐being of their children and youth.</p>
