Improving the lives o\ue01f young people, in ways that are tailored to today\u2019s communities.  At JGC, researchers, Stan\ue01ford students, policy analysts, program directors, civic and community leaders, and o\ue002en, community youth themselves collaborate in a discovery process. Tese partners dive deep into issues that matter to youth: what role health plays in the ability to \ue001ourish in school, how the arts could trans\ue01form a community, what \ue01factors help \u2014 or hinder \u2014 a student\u2019s ability to succeed in college.  Gardner saw JGC as a constructive way to build deep partnerships with the community. His legacy?

While most jobs in San Francisco require some post-secondary education, only about 1 in 5 SFUSD ninth-graders earn a college degree by age 23. As BtS data partner, JGC helped answer a key question: As young people move \ue023rom high school to college, which \ue023actors enhance or impede student success? Using the Youth Data Archive, the Gardner Center linked SFUSD data to CCSF data \ue023or the frst time. Analysis yielded rich insights about transitions. For example, the YDA analysis revealed that many SFUSD students were not taking English and math courses in their frst year at CCSF. Tese students had signifcantly lower trans\ue023er and degree completion rates a\ue002er fve years in contrast to students enrolled in these classes their frst semesters.

YELL (Youth Engaged in Leadership and Learning) was JGC\u2019s frst program. It began as a curriculum developed to give Redwood City and Oakland middle-school students an opportunity to shape not just their own experiences, but the experiences o\ue026 their communities. By cultivating skills in research and analysis, by challenging students to identi\ue026y and address needs, JGC helped launch more than 350 young people into action \u2014 \ue026rom \ue026ounding and leading nonproft advocacy groups to tutoring and mentoring younger students. \ue01doday, the YELL approach is embedded in many JGC projects and is used to support youth leadership and action in a variety o\ue026 contexts nationally and internationally. Te curriculum is available online, \ue026ree o\ue026 charge, to any community that wants to develop youth leadership through research and analysis.      communities Youth learn how to collaborate with adults, and they earn a place at the decision-making table. By developing policies and strategies with school leaders, city advisory board members, and leaders o\ue011 community organizations, young people are involved in real challenges and create real solutions. For many, it\u2019s a trans\ue011ormative frst step to learning what leadership is all about. \u2014 Amalia, YELL alumna and college student in action Resource Mapping  is a research tool that can be used to inventory out-o\ue026-school time programming \ue026or young people in a particular geographic area. In just one example o\ue026 this tool\u2019s impact, in 2009, community leaders in East Palo Alto and the Belle Haven neighborhood o\ue026 Menlo Park came together to solve a mystery: In an area where young people \ue026aced multiple risks and had access to many out-o\ue026-school time programs and opportunities, why weren\u2019t more youth taking advantage o\ue026 those programs? Using a JGC-designed Resource Mapping tool, the communities tackled three key questions: Where were there gaps or duplications among existing programs? How did existing services intersect with the interests o\ue026 young people? What \ue026actors inhibit or promote participation? Community youth were trained to survey peers about interests. By the end o\ue026 the process, the communities had a clear picture o\ue026 what was going on, including gaps in what was available: nothing to do a\ue001er 6 p.m. and on Saturdays, and nothing sports-related \ue026or girls. Issues including access to locations and transit, and specifc inhibitors, including crime \u201chot spots\u201d in the community, also came to light.

But each of these ideas only comes to life when collaborators \u2014 community partners, schools, policymakers, young people, and of course, supporters \u2014 come to the table. As John Gardner said, \u201cAll citizens should have the opportunity to be active, but all will not respond. Those who do respond carry the burden of our free society. I call them the Responsibles.\u201d ","10":"\u201cTe Responsibles exist in every segment o\ue01d the community\u2026but they rarely \ue01dorm a network o\ue01d responsibility \ue01dor the community because o\ue002en they don\u2019t know one another across segments. Tey must fnd each other; learn to communicate and fnd common ground.\u201d And as Gardner wisely points out, it\u2019s never too early to start taking responsibility. Tat\u2019s why JGC\u2019s work \ue01docuses on collaboration, sharing resources, building partnerships.
