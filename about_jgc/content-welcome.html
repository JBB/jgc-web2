<i>“We are continually faced with a series of great opportunities brilliantly disguised as insoluble problems” – John W. Gardner</i>
<br>
<br>
Dear Friends,
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your interest in the John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities, and welcome to our website. Since our founding in 2000 by Professor of Education Milbrey McLaughlin with unwavering support from John W. Gardner, the Gardner Center has created knowledge in communities that ignites change to improve the lives of youth. As a center for rigorous research, deeply rooted in the principles of community youth development, our interdisciplinary team focuses on questions raised by our community partners about issues that matter to youth. Research findings translate into actionable opportunities that communities can put to work – in policy and in practice.
<br>
<br>
John believed that community change and development (“renewal”) needs to come from communities themselves, and that youth are central to community renewal. He also believed that universities like Stanford have an essential role to play in this local work. The Gardner Center expresses these beliefs by fostering reciprocal research collaborations that are co-developed by Stanford and its community partners on equal terms, and the particular contribution of each is acknowledged.
<br>
<br>
The Gardner Center’s collaborative approach is supported by three broad research strategies: integrated longitudinal data analysis, implementation and evaluation research, and community engagement. In turn, we focus these strategies on the targeted policy areas of college and career readiness, early education, youth health and wellness, and youth development practices. Our partners include K-12 and community schools, community colleges, community-based organizations and health care providers, among others. Our work is shared extensively, informing leaders who make policy decisions on the ground in communities throughout the country, and supporting practitioners with tools for school and community leaders to use in fostering youth participation. 
<br>
<br>
I invite you to spend time on the site to learn more about our work in your particular area of interest. Contact us with your questions. Join our mailing list. Attend an event. We welcome your participation.
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,
Amy Gerstein
