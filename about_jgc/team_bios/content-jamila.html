Jamila joined the Gardner Center as a Policy Analyst in February 2014. Prior to joining, she served as the Project Coordinator for a report examining anti-displacement policies and gentrification with the Bay Area housing and immigrants’ rights nonprofit, Causa Justa :: Just Cause. Jamila is driven by the idea that all communities should have access to quality schools and jobs; affordable housing, transportation, and healthcare; healthy food; safe places to play and recreate; and a clean environment. She has worked toward these efforts as a Research Analyst with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, a regional planning agency serving Metro Boston, where she worked on an indicators report looking at social equity in the region across race and class. Jamila also has experience conducting quantitative and qualitative analyses from her work at Mathematica Policy Research, where she worked on a number of evaluations of early childhood and elementary school interventions. Jamila holds a Master’s in City and Regional Planning from the Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University with a concentration in community development, and has a BA in Economics from Spelman College in Atlanta, GA.</p>
