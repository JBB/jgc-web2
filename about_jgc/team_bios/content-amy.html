<p>Amy Gerstein joined the Graduate School of Education as Executive Director of the John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities in 2009. In this capacity, she provides leadership and strategic direction for the Center’s community-based research and policy work. Gerstein brings the rich experience of a career in educational policy and research, curriculum and instruction, district reform, professional development and project management to her leadership role at the Gardner Center.
