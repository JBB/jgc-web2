Tara Chiatovich is a doctoral candidate in Developmental and Psychological Sciences at the Stanford Graduate School of Education. Her doctoral work has focused on how different approaches to instruction relate to learning in the early elementary grades and whether the effectiveness of instructional approaches varies according to students’ level of skill in literacy and math. Her dissertation examines the effect of emphasizing student performance on teachers’ behavior and how teacher behavior relates to child motivation and performance at the preschool level. Before coming to Stanford, Tara worked and studied at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where she received her Master’s degree in International Education Policy.
