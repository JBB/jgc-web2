<p>Carlo recently graduated from Stanford University with a B.A. in Human Biology, concentrating in Child Development and Behavior. He also earned a Minor in Creative Writing, concentrating in Poetry. He has worked with underserved youth from many diverse backgrounds, from Bay Area youth interested in science, to abandoned girls in India who wanted to learn English. Carlo hopes to synthesize these experiences with youth around the world and use them to inform and inspire his work as he studies to become a pediatrician. In his free time, Carlo enjoys reading, writing poetry and comedy, and being with his friends. He is excited to serve as the Shinnyo Fellow for the Gardner Center this year!</p>

<b>ABOUT THE SHINNYO FELLOWSHIP</b> 
<br>
<br>
<p>The Shinnyo Fellowship is an exciting new fellowship that has grown as a result of collaboration among the Shinnyo-en Foundation, the John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities, Redwood City 2020, and the Stanford Haas Center for Public Service. In this one-year fellowship, the fellow will work closely with the Gardner Center and Redwood City 2020, acting as a liaison between research and practice, in addition to taking on additional, self-motivated projects in the community. In addition to the mentorship and guidance given to the fellow from each supervisor, the fellow will also receive support in the form of mentorship under a Stanford alumnus, as well as opportunities to develop professionally. There are many opportunities over the course of the year for reflection and growth, both professionally and personally. At the end of one fulfilling year, the fellow will emerge with a greater understanding of research, policy, and self.
