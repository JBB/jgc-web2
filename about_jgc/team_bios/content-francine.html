Francine holds a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Stanford University and a Minor in Psychology. At Stanford, she partnered with a youth-serving organization in rural Ecuador to understand the challenges the community faces in increasing educational attainment among its youth, and how the organization could better meet community needs. As a Research Assistant in Stanford’s Department of Psychology and Graduate School of Education she contributed to research studies that explored the relationship between task performance and such factors as race, social connection and beliefs surrounding prejudice. She has also worked with several youth-serving organizations in the bay area seeking to improve educational outcomes for first-generation, low-income students of color.
