           <h1 class="content-text-header">Mission</h1>
		<p>The John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities (JGC) at Stanford University partners with 			communities to develop leadership, conduct research and effect change to improve the lives of youth.</p>
		<br>
	
   	   <h1 class="content-text-header">Principles</h1>
		<p>Our work is rooted in the principles of community youth development: a community only prospers when its young people 		prosper, and young people only flourish in a flourishing community.    Specifically, the Center believes in working in deep partnership with communities; bridging the gap between research, practice and policy; generating actionable research; providing opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to contribute to research projects; and ultimately seeking to inform both the community at hand and the broader field about critical findings from our work.</p>
