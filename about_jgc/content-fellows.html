        The Gardner Center is proud to foster opportunities for youth and young adults to participate in the fields of 
        youth development and community-based research. This year we are partnering with the <a href="http://sef.org/programs/shinnyo-fellows-program/">Shinnyo-En Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/haas/students/postgrad/spin">Haas Center for Public Service</a>, and <a href="http://www.publicallies.org/site/c.liKUL3PNLvF/b.2775815/k.20E5/BE_AN_ALLY.htm">Public Allies</a> to host two post-undergraduate fellows, Sophia Colombari Figueroa and  Cody Young, to collaborate with youth-serving organizations in our near neighbor communities of East Palo Alto and Redwood City, respectively.

Cody Young is the latest addition to the Gardner Center’s East Palo Alto Youth Arts & Music Center team. Her role is to organize, empower, and support a group of youth participants in the creation of the East Palo Alto Youth Art and Music Center. Prior to her Public Allies placement with the Gardner Center, Cody was the Community Project Director for The Social Awareness Network for Activism through Art (SANAA) at UCLA. At SANAA, Cody established and maintained a safe space for South Los Angeles High School students to engage in the process of critical dialogue, critical thinking, and artistic freedom. Cody has also conducted research on how Black male college students express their thoughts about their presence within higher education through music. She is passionate about empowering and valuing the voices of under-represented people in all spaces. She also brings experience in constructing yearly and quarterly funding proposals and grants, working with incarcerated youth, and community engagement. Cody holds two BAs in Anthropology and African American Studies from The University of California, Los Angeles.
