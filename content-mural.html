        The mural, designed by Omar Ramirez and completed by 27 teen artists, was created for Stanford University by the Mural, Music & Arts Project (MMAP), an award-winning program that inspires positive youth outcomes through the arts. 
        
        The 10-by-5-foot work is displayed at the John W. Gardner Center (JGC) as an expression of the deep partnership that exists between MMAP and JGC. "The relationship has been there from the beginning," said Sonya Clark-Herrera, Executive Director of MMAP. "JGC helped establish MMAP by participating in a collaborative effort of setting goals, developing evaluative tools, and formalizing the organization. They even gave us our first classroom space and a mailing address." JGC Founding Faculty Director Milbrey McLaughlin now sits on the board of directors of the thriving organization. The relationship between MMAP and JGC continues as they partner with youth and adult community leaders on the development of a <a href="/our_work/youth_art_music.html">Youth Arts, Music and Cultural Center in East Palo Alto</a>.
