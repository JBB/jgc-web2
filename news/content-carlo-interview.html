<br>
<br>
<b>Tell us about yourself and how you got to the Gardner Center.</b>
<br>
<br>
<p>My name is Carlo Pasco and I graduated from Stanford University this past spring with a B.A. in Human Biology, concentrating in Child Development and Behavior, and a Minor in Creative Writing, concentrating in Poetry. I have worked with underserved youth from diverse backgrounds, from Bay Area youth interested in science to abandoned girls in India who wanted to learn English. I hope to bring together these experiences with youth and use them to inform and inspire my work as I study to become a pediatrician. In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing poetry and comedy, and being with my friends.</p>
<br> 
<p>I am just beginning a year-long journey as the Shinnyo Fellow working with the Gardner Center and Redwood City 2020. These organizations, in collaboration with the Haas Center for Public Service and the Shinnyo-en Foundation, have put in countless hours to make this position possible for me, and I am incredibly lucky to serve all of them at once.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b>How will your prior experience inform your thoughts about working with youth, communities, and education, and how do you expect this position to shift your perspective on these topics and on your own experience of being a youth?</b>
<br>
<br> 
<p>I have had varied, yet valuable, experiences with youth in different communities. In the summer of 2011, I was a counselor for the Stanford Medical Youth Science Program that invites Bay Area high school students from low-income backgrounds to live on campus while learning anatomy, getting lectures from prominent Stanford professors, and receiving help with SATs and college personal statements. In addition to these skills, this program also focused on ideas like health disparities, identity, power, privilege, and encouraged students to go back to their communities and share what they’d learned.</p>
<br> 
<p>In the summer of 2012, I spent six weeks teaching English in a small village in India. This experience encapsulates youth, education, and community, as I got to see how just a little action on my part in the grand scheme of things could have such positive effects for my students down the road. The girls I taught were orphans, abandoned by their parents simply because they were born female and their parents could not afford to raise a girl. The Non-Governmental Organization that housed and educated them, Aarti Home, firmly believes that education is the path necessary to empower and embolden these young women. A good education shows them that they can be self reliant and that they have intrinsic worth that can be valuable to their community.</p>
<br> 
<p>I am hoping that my experience as a Shinnyo Fellow will allow me to enhance these anecdotal experiences with a more research-based one. While it feels good knowing, in my head, the positive contribution that education can have on youth in various communities, getting to see concrete proof of this would be extremely satisfying. I am very excited to see the data on how big of a benefit that these projects and interventions are making.</p>
<br> 
<p>In terms of my own youth, I hope that this experience enables me to reflect more on how lucky I have been to have had very few obstacles to education in my life. I also hope that interacting with administrators and other community leaders makes me more appreciative, not only of my hard-working teachers, but also all the behind-the-scenes people (policy makers, administrators, district staff, etc.) that played a part in my education.</p>
<br>
<br> 
<b>What about Redwood City makes it a compelling place in which to work? What are its strengths, its distinct features?</b>
<br>
<br> 
<p>Redwood City is an incredibly diverse community, serving many different populations. Looking at past census reports, Redwood City has a good mix of cultures, age groups, races and ethnicities, and socioeconomic statuses. I have only lived in Redwood City for about 2 weeks, but it seems like everyone who lives there shares a sense of community and values community involvement. Having so many community supporters—schools, government, business, and more—really makes for an overall better living experience, and may play a part in producing happier, more fortified people (we’ll see what the research says!).</p>
<br> 
<p>The diverse cultures and opinions also make it a very good city to work in from a research perspective. Researchers can gain many perspectives on a problem, which is an important step toward addressing that problem. The opportunity to work in such a vibrant and diverse community like Redwood City is a unique one, one that I do not intend to waste.</p> 
<br>
<br>
<b>What are your future plans and how call this fellowship help realize your goals?</b>
<br>
<br>
<p>I hope one day to be a pediatrician or family doctor. The skills necessary for being a pediatrician overlap very well with the skills needed to work in this fellowship, namely relationship building and listening to a community’s needs in order to gain  their trust and help them. There’s also an element of humility involved in both professions: going in to either with the attitude that there’s nothing more to learn will ultimately be detrimental to everyone involved. It would be much more productive if the “helper” had an open attitude. Listening to someone’s needs is crucial in assisting them, be it in a school or a hospital.</p>
<br>
<br> 
<b>What are some issues facing youth today, and what approach should we take in tackling these issues?</b>
<br>
<br>
<p>Obviously, a huge issue is education, specifically education disparity. I am a believer that many of the problems we face as a country—health and wellness issues, financial issues, economic issues—can all be addressed by education. But it can only be effective if all our children, no matter what race, gender, socioeconomic status or other factor, are receiving a high quality education. Unfortunately, this is virtually impossible right now, with the system the way it is currently. I believe that, in the absence of a large systemic change, there are manageable, innovative things we can do to offset this growing disparity. The research that the Gardner Center has done via the Youth Data Archive to analyze data for a specific community to answer that community’s questions does just this. The great work done here is just a small step in chipping away at an ever-expanding education gap, but it is crucial. I am excited to have the opportunity to help the Gardner Center with their mission as well as serve the city of Redwood City with the help of the Gardner Center’s resources.</p>
