<span class="content-bold">GARDNER CENTER SYMPOSIUM</span><br>
<br>
SATURDAY, APRIL 18<br> 
Enhancing Knowledge About Data Use and Inquiry in University-Community Research Partnerships: Insights from Four Case Examples<br>
Sheraton, Second Level, Colorado<br>
8:15 a.m. to 9:45 a.m.<br>
<br>
<p>Through four in-depth case illustrations of university-community collaborations, we seek to spark a robust discussion about the merits and challenges of research-practice partnerships as a strategy to address enduring problems of practice in education. The papers in this symposium deal with many issues, which range from power dynamics to data use practices to ensuring that partnership processes are respectful of cultural differences. Through these four case examples, we seek to advance knowledge about research-practice partnerships and draw attention to key considerations and practices that facilitate and sustain these types of collaborations.
