<span class="content-italic">Nicole M. Ardoin, Sebastian Castrechini, Mary K. Hofstedt</span><br>
20.047. Participatory Action Research: Student, Teacher, and Community Voices (SIG-Action Research - Paper Session)<br>
Marriott Pinnacle, Fourth Level, Ambleside, Fri, Apr 13, 2:15pm - 3:45pm<br>
<br>
<p>This paper explores the role of youth participatory action research in the context of a university-community partnership. Using qualitative data from interviews and field notes from youth and adults involved in two participatory research projects, we examine the ways in which involvement in participatory action research affects perceptions of their community, the role of youth in the community, and the partnership between the university and the community.</p>

31.060. Community Schools: Collective Trust, Collective Action, and Collective Impact (SIG-Family, School, Community Partnerships - Symposium)<br>
Vancouver Convention Centre, Second Level - East Room 17, Sat, Apr 14 - 12:25pm - 1:55pm<br>
<br>
<p>This paper proposes a theoretical model for researching community schools as a way of advancing the field of community schools research. The paper provides a framework based in ecological systems theory that incorporates processes from the resiliency, motivation, and social reproduction literatures that specifically apply to community school and also provides suggestions for conducting research in community schools using this framework.</p>

55.039. High School Reform: Examining Factors Related to Attendance, School Engagement, and Credit Recovery (Division H - Research, Evaluation and Assessment in Schools - Paper Session)<br> 
Marriott Pinnacle, Third Level, Pinnacle II;  Mon, Apr 16, 2012, 12:25 - 1:55pm<br>
<br>
<p>When students are not in school, they miss the opportunity to grow academically, socially, and emotionally. Research has shown that students with low attendance are at heightened risk of potentially deleterious behavior. Although there is an extensive body of research in the area of truancy, chronic absenteeism is not generally measured or tracked and is therefore not well understood. This analysis explores the causes and consequences of chronic absenteeism in a San Francisco Bay Area community and determines which characteristics are correlated with studentsâ€™ chronic absenteeism and academic outcomes for students who are chronically absent.</p>
