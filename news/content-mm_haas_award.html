Congratulations to JGC Founding Faculty Director Milbrey McLaughlin, a 2012 recipient of the Friends of Haas Award from Stanfordâ€™s Haas Center for Public Service. The Friends of Haas Award recognizes campus staff, faculty, alumni, and community partners who have demonstrated a long-term commitment to the mission, values, and principles of the Haas Center. Individuals selected as Friends of Haas have greatly contributed to the support and execution of public service education, initiatives, and programming for the university community. This is the second year in a row that the Haas Center has recognized JGC for its contributions to public service; program manager Mary Hofstedt was honored in 2011.
<br><br>
Congratulations Milbrey!
