<span class="content-bold">Mary Hofstedt Receives 2012 Milbrey McLaughlin Community Action Award</span><br>
<br>
<img class="bio-std" src="/images/team/Mary.jpg">
On Wednesday, October 12, community leaders including Supervisor Rose Jacobs Gibson and Mayor Laura Martinez applauded as JGC’s Mary Hofstedt received the 2012 Milbrey W. McLaughlin Community Action Award from the Mural Music & Arts Project (MMAP) in East Palo Alto.  The award, presented at MMAP’s Expanding Reach luncheon, recognizes an individual whose commitment to community action benefits youth in East Palo Alto, and honors JGC Founding Director Milbrey McLaughlin’s foundational support of MMAP. A double celebration for JGC! 
<br>
<br>
Presenting the award, Aria Florant, MMAP Director of Youth and Community Development, described Mary as “an incredibly willing and dedicated mentor, colleague, friend, and community member. Through her work with the Youth Arts and Music Center project, a grassroots, collaborative, youth led initiative to bring a Youth Arts and Music Center to East Palo Alto, Mary makes our youth, our staff, our organization, and our community better. Her thoughtfulness and compassion are absolutely unparalleled, and the skills and experiences she has brought to our youth are invaluable. Mary sees and honors the good in everyone, and through the example she sets, everyone around her comes to be better employees and people.”
<br>

<br>
We recently sat down with Mary to talk about this honor and learn more about her work in EPA.
 <br>
<br>
<i>Congratulations on receiving the Milbrey award! Please tell us about the work you are doing in EPA that is recognized by this award.</i>
<br>
<br>
I have facilitated The Youth Arts & Music Center project since 2010. I have been an instrument in the collective work—providing coordination, training and process structure so that others, including young people, can do what they do best.  It really is a collective honor—celebrating the people that I have been fortunate enough to work alongside.  
<br>
<br>
<i>How does this award benefit the community?</i>
<br>
<br>
It demonstrates the value of collaborative work and youth as agents of change within their communities and beyond. Hopefully, this award does not highlight "my" work, as much as the principles of university-community partnership, youth as experts and partners in the issues and opportunities of their time, and the power and energy young people have to bring innovation, energy, and positive change to their world. 
<br>
<br>
<i>Given your close relationship with Milbrey, how does it feel to be the Milbrey recipient?!</i>
<br>
<br>
Humbling. Especially with Milbrey sitting in the audience! I think differently about young people and community because of her.  I remember a young person I worked with saying they wanted to be like John Gardner when they grew up. It was a moment of great delight for me. I guess that I strive to embody the vision and integrity of Milbrey's work—perhaps a bit like that young person was striving toward the qualities of John Gardner. To think I've made some headway—particularly as a representative of the JGC—is wonderful.

Congratulations Mary! We’re proud of you!
