<span class="content-bold">GARDNER CENTER TAILORS COMMUNITY YOUTH DEVELOPMENT COURSE FOR POLS STUDENTS</span><br>
<br>
<p><i>For a list of readings and topics covered in the Community Youth Development course, please see the <a href="/resources/publications/Sp2013POLSSyllabus.pdf">Course Syllabus.</a></i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>The Stanford Graduate School of Education’s Policy, Organization, and Leadership Studies (POLS) program attracts students seeking to improve educational policy, programs, and practices.  Over the course of a nine month, full-time Masters’ program, POLS equips students with the knowledge and skills needed to take on formal and informal leadership roles in the field of education.  Each year, the majority of students enter the POLS program with a focus on either K-12 education or higher education.  A small but growing number of students choose to focus on community-based organizations and a community-wide perspective on education.</p>  
<br>
<p>During the 2012-2013 school year, a group of POLS students wanted to delve deeply into the theories and empirical research on community-based education and after school programming. When they shared their interests with department faculty they were directed to the Gardner Center for guidance. Two POLS students approached the Gardner Center with a request for an independent study or a directed reading group. This initial conversation led to the creation of a new POLS course entitled “Community Youth Development” and the subsequent enrollment of eight students during spring quarter 2013.</p>  
<br>
<p>The course was co-developed by an interdisciplinary Gardner Center team including both researchers and practitioners:  Milbrey McLaughlin, the Gardner Center’s founding director and the David Jacks Professor of Education and Public Policy Emeritus; Karen Strobel, a Senior Research Associate whose work focuses on adolescent development and motivation; and Mary Hofstedt Senior Community Engagement Associate who works directly with youth, programs and community-wide efforts.  The three worked together to design a syllabus that drew on their different areas of expertise and was responsive to the students’ interests.</p>
<br>
<p>All of the students who enrolled in the class were exploring their role as agents of change.  Some students came to the class determined to change system-level structures and inequities to better serve low-income youth.  Others were interested in practices that would improve program quality for youth participating in community-based organizations.  Regardless of their desired points of entry into the field of education, all of the POLS students in this class wanted to learn about the theories and practices that guided a community perspective on education and youth development.</p>
<br>
<p>The students’ multiple interests aligned with the Gardner Center’s tri-level approach focusing on the interactions of the embedded individual (youth/student), setting (school, classroom, program) and system (district, public agency and community) levels, and the ways that changes at one level directly connect to the other levels.  The course readings were designed to complement the knowledge students were gaining through their other GSE courses, and encourage critical thinking about the role of diverse settings in youth development outcomes.  Readings and discussions explored the intersections of theory, research and practice.  Through guest speakers that included a young community leader, a Community School Coordinator and a City Manager, students were prompted to connect research to practice and reflect on individual, setting and system level experiences and opportunities.</p>
<br>
<p>Students who started the quarter placing themselves as system-level change agents, ended the quarter valuing the roles of the individuals and settings that comprise the system. Similarly, students who initially focused on specific programs separate from system-level issues, ended the quarter with an appreciation for the system within which their program functions. In their final reflections, students commented on the shifts in their mindsets towards cross-sector collaborations and more holistic ways of thinking about education within a community setting. As one student wrote, <i>“Through this experience, my mindset has been altered in significant ways… and I am extremely grateful to you all for your part in that.”</i></p>
<br>
<p>More than one student said that the class helped them to regain a sense of hope and encouraged solutions to challenges they had once perceived as intractable.  Comments included: <i>"Thank you all for such a wonderful quarter. You created a safe, stimulating environment to consider complex issues," and "(this course) was one of the most intellectually and personally rewarding experiences of my year at Stanford."</i></p>
<br>
<p>The students who participated in the Spring 2013 course have now graduated and are working to improve the lives of youth in communities across the US.  They take with them the lessons learned and knowledge gained from all of their courses in the GSE. The Gardner Center course that they initiated and helped design served as a forum to reflect on the intersection of their newly acquired academic insights and their pursuits of particular career paths and opportunities.</p>
<br>
<p><i>“Thank you so much for hosting the Community Youth Development directed reading this spring. It was the pinnacle of my Stanford experience. The fact that I am now working in the community schools field in Oakland shows how instrumental the course was in helping me define my professional path and philosophical beliefs about youth, communities, education, and youth development.”</i> Shawn Koval, MA’13</p>
