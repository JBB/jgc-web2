<span class="content-bold">JGC RECEIVES GRANT TO FACILITATE BAY AREA COMMUNITY SCHOOLS GROUP</span><br>
<br>
The John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities at Stanford University (JGC) was awarded a grant from The San Francisco Foundation to support JGC’s role as convener and facilitator for the Bay Area Community School Intermediaries Group.<br>
<br>
"We are grateful for this generous grant from The San Francisco Foundation. By bringing together the expertise of numerous organizations in the community schools field in the Bay Area, we are able to do much more than we can do alone to support the goals that districts and communities have for their youth and families," said Maria Fernandez, JGC Senior Policy and Program Manager.<br>
<br>
In a nation where 42 percent of children live in low-income families, too many schools are faced with the challenge of teaching students burdened with unmet needs that pose obstacles to learning. Community schools that align schools and community resources are a promising strategy for improving student outcomes by providing wraparound services that meet the social, physical, cognitive, and economic needs of both students and families.<br>
<br>
However, community schools encounter complex barriers that can prevent them from flourishing, including the fact that community school intermediaries (the community-based organizations that provide support and services to the schools) operate independently of each other, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive and easily navigable systems of support.<br>
<br>
To address these obstacles, for the past two years JGC has convened a Bay Area Community School Intermediaries Group to facilitate a partnership that coordinates and accelerates the community-based organizations’ collective work. By working more collaboratively, intermediaries can better support community schools in serving youth and families.<br>
<br>
The partnership has already established a more cohesive organizational purpose and role in the Bay Area community schools landscape. Outcomes include a framework for an overall system of technical assistance, advocacy and support available to community schools seeking assistance, and channels for providing intermediaries with knowledge and integrated strategies for leveraging one another’s work.<br>
<br>
JGC will convene the next meeting of the Bay Area Community School Intermediaries Group on April 25, 2012. In May, JGC will facilitate the group’s participation in the national conference of the Coalition of Community Schools, which will take place in San Francisco.<br>
<br>
"The Gardner Center is appreciative of this grant from The San Francisco Foundation. With it, we are able to expand upon the work we have done since early 2010 with the support of the Stuart Foundation," said Amy Gerstein, JGC Executive Director. "We are so pleased to add The San Francisco Foundation to the list of active, influential partners who are helping us to support the potential of community schools In the Bay Area and beyond."<br>
