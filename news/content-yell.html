<i>“Many young people wonder whether they have any place in this vast and complicated society of ours.  They feel anonymous and rootless and alienated…..In my judgment there isn’t any quicker cure for that ailment than evidence that their society needs them.”</i> — John W. Gardner
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>John Gardner believed that youth needed to know they matter—that they are part of the movements and decisions and import of the time and place in which they live. He also believed that community renewal requires young voices, energy, perspective and participation to create solutions and foster life-long tendencies toward civic engagement. These beliefs are at the heart of YELL: youth leadership training in which youth engage in authentic, meaningful projects that they define and implement themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>Created in 2000, YELL was launched as the inaugural project of the newly established John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities, providing 15 eighth grade students with training as community researchers, advisors, and socially-conscious leaders. Over the next six years, the Gardner Center expanded YELL to engage hundreds of Bay Area middle- and high school students in the use of research techniques to study issues of concern to them and use their findings to formulate policy recommendations and action plans. Making formal presentations to relevant stakeholders including school faculty, city council members, and journalists, YELL-trained youth heard their opinions valued and experienced how youth and adults can work together on shared community concerns including bully awareness and prevention, public art, family health center development, stereotype and bias awareness, transportation access, and more. These are experiences that provide youth with, in John Gardner’s words, “evidence that their society needs them.”</p> 
<br>
<p>The development of the YELL curriculum provided numerous points of engagement for Stanford students, whose contributions to the project were significant. The work supported undergraduate honors theses, doctoral dissertations and both service learning and work-study opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and produced a number of journal articles and book chapters that contributed to the body of youth development knowledge. In 2006, the Gardner Center transitioned the YELL program leadership to schools and community-based organizations and made the YELL curriculum available, free of charge, to anyone interested in training and engaging youth as partners and leaders within their communities.</p> 
<br>
<p>Fast forward from 2000—when the program served the original 15 students—to 2014, when today the YELL curriculum is in high demand from youth-serving organizations across the country and around the world.  Gardner Center communications staffer Leslie Patron “stopped counting after 70 countries” when asked where inquiries about YELL come from,  noting that the top ten places outside of the U.S. are: Philippines, Australia, United Kingdom, Nigeria, South Africa, Japan, Pakistan, New Zealand, Malaysia, and Singapore. Leslie said the YELL web page has had over 10,000 visitors in the past year.</p> 
<br>
<p>“The range of requests for YELL is incredible,” says Gardner Center Senior Community Engagement Associate Mary Hofstedt, who began working with the YELL curriculum in 2003. “We receive inquiries about YELL from a variety of settings—schools, foundations, nonprofits, government agencies—and for a range of purposes, from youth philanthropy to mentoring to English language development to leadership to violence prevention. Because it is a youth development model and a process-based curriculum the tool is highly adaptable to context.”</p>
<br>
<p>While Mary fields many questions about adapting and structuring the curriculum for a particular setting, she frequently finds that the conversations end up back at the underlying framework of the tool: How do you think about youth? What are the underlying beliefs of adults? How do you shift from traditional teacher to facilitator? “These are the shifts that are most exciting,” Mary says, “because people know their settings and have expertise in their area. But to make this shift to youth as resources, as partners, as people who are guiding and forming their own content and sense of place—is huge.”</p>
<br>
<p>In addition to making the curriculum available for download and fielding questions from around the world, the Gardner Center keeps the YELL approach firmly rooted in many of our community-based projects. Asked to elaborate, Hofstedt says “The Gardner Center’s principles of youth development work are embedded in YELL—the curriculum is just one more tool to help strengthen the voices and engagement of youth in schools and communities.”  She adds that “There are a lot of other great resources out there—from terrific organizations like Forum for Youth Investment and the Innovation Center, but YELL is unique in its scope. It is a 320-page curriculum with tons of room for adaptation. It is also based on six years of experience—and was co-developed by youth participants through the process. It grew from experience and practice, and was deeply informed by research.”</p>
