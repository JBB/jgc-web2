<p>At an elegant reception hosted by Graduate School of Education Dean Claude Steele, more than 100 friends, family members, students, and colleagues gathered in January to celebrate the retirement of our founding director Milbrey McLaughlin, professor emerita of education and public policy.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Stanford President John Hennessy spoke about the Gardner Center being the shared vision of Milbrey and John Gardner about how best to support and develop young people.  McLaughlin said that her commitment to the Gardner Center focused on two main objectives. One was that it be an unconventional research center relying on the neighboring community for shaping and conducting its work. The other was that the center’s work meets the rigorous research standards of the university. That the center succeeded on both counts is clear; both Hennessy and Steele hailed her pioneering research models as connecting to and informing practice in ways that extend the benefits of research far beyond the university campus.</p>
<br>
<p>McLaughlin came to Stanford in 1983 as an associate professor of education, and in 2000 was named the David Jacks Professor of Education and Public Policy. Her research—then and now—is focused on identifying and understanding the cross-institutional issues that shape the settings within and through which youth move, and on advancing a youth sector stance to inform policy and practice. Gardner Center Executive Director Amy Gerstein said, “Instead of deciding what to study from the perspective of the university, we approach the community and ask what questions they need answers to. Community members collaborate with Stanford researchers, building capacity and learning to make data-driven decisions in the process.”</p>
<br>
<p>Tom Ehrlich, former dean of Stanford Law School and the first advisor of the new Gardner Center, said that while Gardner refused to lend his name to other projects, this collaboration with McLaughlin was different. “From the outset, Milbrey shared John’s vision that youth development should be viewed as a whole, and that drug use, teenage pregnancy, truancy, youth crime, and all the other problems that are so commonly viewed as unrelated challenges to youth development needed to be handled together,” he said.</p>
<br>
<p>Prudence Carter, Gardner Center faculty director since September 2013, noted that in addition to its near-neighbor work, the center now addresses statewide and national questions about youth development. Carter added that McLaughlin recruited her to Stanford in 2007: “I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for her,” she said. “Now I’m trying to carry on the legacy of an intellectual foreparent.”</p>
<br>
<p>Deborah Alvarez-Rodriguez, another Gardner Center advisor, said that in her work as a social services entrepreneur she has referred many to the Gardner Center. “They really understand how to bring all the pieces together in a way to achieve concrete outcomes,” she said.</p>
<br>
<p>Patrick Shields, McLaughlin’s first graduate student, reminded attendees that she was already a force in educational policy when he arrived at Stanford. He added that McLaughlin’s impact “goes far beyond research and what she’s written. She has, of course, mentored many of us.”</p>
